# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this page is to have a study guide I can fall back on when I need it. I built this Page as a better wa to understand and to learn. 

The problem it solves for me, is it helps me to randomly choose which tpic I;m going to study in depth that day during the 2 hour block I set for it. 

I learned how to use JavaScript. I already had the fundimentals of HTML and CSS. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for me to study first. This is perferble to having to pick by yourself, as humans naturally shy away from things that are hard. I you were to get a random pick, and follow through, you will find out that not everything that is hard, is scary. You'll learn to accept whats hard, and how to persuvere throughout it.
